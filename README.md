# AI_Chatbot

Created a chatbot for the college website using Python, designed to assist students and visitors by answering queries and providing information. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to understand user inputs and deliver accurate responses. Integrated with the college's database to offer real-time information on courses, events, and other campus-related activities.
